## Getting Started

Verify that Node.js is successfully installed by running `node -v`. If Node.js is not installed, install it.

Install discord.js by running `npm install discord.js`.

Add this bot to a server. Instructions can be found [in the discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html#bot-invite-links).

When first cloning the repository, run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

To start the bot, run `npm start`.

## `config.json`

You need to create your own `config.json` file. It should be in the following format:

```json
{
  "prefix": "<prefix>",
  "token": "<token>",
  "start": "<start date>"
}
```
