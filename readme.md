## Getting Started

Verify that Node.js is successfully installed by running `node -v`. If Node.js is not installed, install it.

Install discord.js by running `npm install discord.js`.

Add this bot to a server. Instructions can be found [in the discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html#bot-invite-links).

It might be helpful to use nodemon when making changes so that the bot is restarted on a file change. Install nodemon as a development dependency by running `npm install --save-dev nodemon` and then start the local installation using `npx nodemon`.
